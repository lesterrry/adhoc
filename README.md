# Adhoc
This is a very basic approach to [CLTK](https://github.com/cltk/cltk), made to provide reference for words I stumble upon whilst learning Latin. 

### Example usage
```
Enter word > canem
  Canem
  POS: noun
  NUM: singular
  CASE: accusative
  DECL:
            SING    PLUR
    ------  ------  -------
    Nom     canis   canes
    Gen     canis   canum
    Dat     cani    canibus
    Acc     canem   canes
    Abl     cane    canibus
    Voc     canis   canes
  DEF:
